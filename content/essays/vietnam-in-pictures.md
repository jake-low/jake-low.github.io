In my final year of college, I worked on a project for a major online travel company. Three other students and I designed and built an app that would ask users about their travel preferences, have them choose their favorite vacation-themed pictures from a collage, and then recommend destinations.

Towards the end of the year, I spent weeks cleaning our data sets and retweaking the machine learning algorithms in order to improve the app's recommendations. I ran through the app hundreds of times, sometimes pretending to be a wine enthusiast a thrill-seeker or a honey&shy;mooner, and sometimes just being myself.

With increasing frequency, the app began to recommend to me (the real me) that I just _had_ to go to Southeast Asia. So I did. The Monday after my graduation ceremony, I was on a plane to Saigon, hastily paging through _Teach Yourself Vietnamese_.

When I arrived, I was overwhelmed by the noise, the bustle, and the oppressive heat. As I became acclimated, I realized that the frenetic energy of the city has a certain charm. Nonetheless, after a few days of exploring I wanted to escape the chaos, so I set out into the countryside.

For the next month, I wound my way north towards Hanoi. Everywhere I went, people were friendly to me and interested in my impression of their country. My Vietnamese improved day-by-day, as did my photographs.

In the countryside, I met farmers, shop owners, and craftspeople. I stayed in village longhouses and in people's homes. I made small-talk with people, practicing my Vietnamese. When I met someone who spoke English (or someone around happened to be able to translate), I asked about their work, their history, and their hopes for the future.

I began developing more courage in asking people if I could take their portraits. I wanted to remember the connections I had been so fortunate to make. These photographs are still some of my favorites, because I look at them and remember the conversations we had.

When I arrived in Hanoi, I discovered that my outbound flight had been delayed by a few days. So I decided to spend the unexpected extra time in Sapa, a mountain town in the far northwest known for its picturesque rice terraces.

Seeing the northwest made me realize that I had to come back to Vietnam. The highlands are a labyrinth of craggy valleys and little villages tucked up against the mountainsides. Communities here are largely self-sufficient (a necessity of their isolation). The northwest is home to many of Vietnam's ethnic minority communities. People here spoke languages I'd never heard and grew traditional crops I'd never seen.

In 2017, I returned to Vietnam. I spent three months in the country and four weeks just in the northwest. I learned more about the agriculture, traditions, crafts, and languages of the groups that live in this region. And everywhere I went, I took photographs, hoping to capture my impressions of this unique place.

I learned most people living in the highlands are subsistence farmers, who depend on their land for the food they eat. Farming is hard here. The land is rocky and must be leveled into terraces before it can be used. Rainfall is low, and the climate and elevation permits just a single rice harvest per year. Some families grow maize or cassava in the off-season. In good years these low-nutrient crops are fed to pigs and chickens, but in times of scarcity they are consumed by humans too.

In these isolated towns, textiles and farm tools are made by skilled local craftspeople. In H'mong communities, hemp is woven into cloth and dyed with indigo to make clothing. Wax resist is used to create intricate patterns. In Giáy communities, cotton is spun and dyed, then woven into elaborate plaid patterns.

Economic interaction with the wider world is limited, but growing. Many households now have a motorbike. A few have a cell phone. Sói, who hosted me in her home in Tả Van village, told me she buys coffee and shampoo at the market in a nearby town.

But many people living in the northwest cannot easily travel to a market.
Most roads are in poor condition, which limits mobility. Without ready access to a market, farming families have no reliable way to sell their surplus crop, or buy everyday necessities. They also have no opportunity to work side jobs; farming is the only way they can support themselves. In Sapa, where tourists regularly visit, Yao women (who walk for miles to the central market in order to sell their handicrafts) have resorted to sleeping in the market rather than making the return trip on the same day.

When I decided, based on the suggestion of an app that I wrote, to go to Vietnam on vacation, I expected to spend a few weeks eating delicious food and looking at a lot of old temples. And I did. What I did not expect was that the country would embed itself in my brain, and that I would spend months afterwards thinking about how I could make a positive impact on the lives of the people I met there.

When I next visit Vietnam, I'm hoping to do so as a researcher, studying nutrition and health issues and contributing useful knowledge to the global development community. Until then, I'll keep looking back over my photographs and remembering the connections I made.

<!--

I still feel that I have only scratched the surface of Vietnam. There is so much more I want to learn about the agriculture, language, and customs of the ethnic groups that live here. And I want to share what I discover with others.


TODO move this somewhere else

I think that one of the most effective ways to improve the world is to promote understanding across cultural and geographic boundaries. People are social creatures, and therefore inherently empathic. But in our entertainment-driven culture, it's too easy to remain ignorant of the hardships faced by millions of people in the developing world.

As I've said before, [I think the world needs more educational journalism](#). How to create and share these stories has been on my mind lately. I've been thinking both about how I can create and share educational stories on the web, and how I can build tools that will allow others to do so. If you're interested


I also think that a lot of people want to learn more about the world beyond their horizons, but don't know where to find high-quality information. I know I don't. U.S. news media is largely focused on our own political structures, and modern news has lost interest in

I'd love to read more about important global development topics -- like family planning programs in Ethiopia or polio eradication in India -- but in order to do that I have to be my own content curator. Plenty of material exists on important global development topics like these, but this material is not usually written for a general audience, nor are there major news media outlets that

Plenty of material
